    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This might at least help find malicious code that could have been injected in module files. Does a cool side-by-side diff and exports to a file so you can easily move through the file and see any differences.</p>

<p>In the following command make sure to put the &lsquo;good&rsquo; drupal install before the potentially &lsquo;bad&rsquo; or existing install.</p>

<p>In this case &lsquo;drupal&rsquo; is just a
<code>
git clone --branch 7.x http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git
</code>
and a
<code>
git checkout 7.32
</code>
and &lsquo;pre-update&rsquo; is my old drupal install that I want to check for malicious code.</p>

<p>In this case the &ldquo;drupal&rdquo; directory will be on the left. Just switch them around to see the other directory on the left. I chose to do it this way because I wanted to see everything for the the &ldquo;good&rdquo; code and see just lines that were different in what I had before the update.</p>

<p><code>
diff -r -y --left-column drupal pre-update  &gt; dirdiff.txt
</code></p>

<p>This does a recursive (-r) diff and places the results side-by-side (-y) in a file. The (&mdash;left-column) makes it easier to spot the diff.</p>

<p>On mac you can just hold down <code>fn + (down arrow)</code></p>

<p>You should at least see:</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://scottalan.github.io/images/mine/diff.png">http://scottalan.github.io/images/mine/diff.png</a>"></p>

<p>This is the patch that was posted for Drupal core: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/SA-CORE-2014-005-D7.patch">https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/SA-CORE-2014-005-D7.patch</a></p>

<h2>Also</h2>

<p>Something else you can do for any code you may have been version controlling (we all version control our custom code, right?):</p>

<p>I looked back through my git branches, as I tend to keep them for quite sometime, and I found a branch that I had labeled updates-10-13-14 so I know that these are any updates I may have pushed on the 13th of October. This is two days before the &lsquo;catastrophe&rsquo; so this code shouldn&rsquo;t be affected. I&rsquo;m working with the Panopoly distro as my base install so all of my custom code exists in sites/all and that&rsquo;s what I push to GitHub. In the sites directory I placed a directory called: old_all. So here is what I did:</p>

<p>From your sites directory:</p>

<p><code>
mkdir old_all
cd old_all
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:scottalan/[NAME_OF_REPO].git
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/updates-10-13-14
</code></p>

<p>Now I have my PRE &lsquo;possible hack&rsquo; code in old_all and where ever I am now in the original all directory. Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of running the diff command.</p>

<p><code>
diff -r -y --left-column old_all all  &gt; all-diff.txt
</code></p>

<p>You could also exclude certain files to give you less to look through:
<code>
diff -r -y --exclude=*.css --left-column old_all all  &gt; all-diff.txt
</code></p>

<p>This would exclude any CSS files for example.</p>

<p>Now I can see a side by side diff of the changes. Of course you will see things that you recognize changing but keep an eye out for anything that doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right.</p>

<p>Sure this is tedious but a heck of a lot better then trying to look through each file individually.</p>

<p>Good Luck! Don&rsquo;t forget to checkout: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalsa05FAQ">https://www.drupal.org/drupalsa05FAQ</a></p>
